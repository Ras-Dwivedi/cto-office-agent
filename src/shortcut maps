🎛️ workctl Shortcut Design Principles

Before the map, these are the rules we follow (important):

Single-letter flags are for frequent actions

Letters should be mnemonic

No collisions

Shortcuts never replace canonical commands

Flags = actions, Commands = nouns

This keeps the CLI intuitive under stress.

🧭 Core Shortcut Map (Recommended)
🔥 Daily-use shortcuts (muscle memory)
Shortcut	Command	Meaning	Why this letter
-p	pomodoro	Focus session	Pomodoro
-t	priority	Top priority tasks	Top tasks
-f	follow-ups (future)	What am I waiting on	Follow-up
-n	next (future)	What should I do next	Next action

These should become reflexes.

🧠 Thinking & reflection shortcuts
Shortcut	Command	Meaning
-d	record-decision	Log a decision
-m	generate-markdown	Generate report / summary

Mnemonic:

Decide

Markdown / Memo

🤖 Automation & agents
Shortcut	Command	Meaning
-a	create-tasks	Run email → task agent
-r	run-agents (future)	Run all background agents

Use these sparingly — agents shouldn’t need frequent manual triggers.

🛠️ Meta / system shortcuts
Shortcut	Command	Meaning
-s	status (future)	System health
-h	help	Help (standard)
-v	version (future)	Version info
✅ Canonical Commands (Never removed)

Shortcuts are aliases, not replacements.

These should always work:

workctl pomodoro
workctl priority
workctl create-tasks
workctl record-decision

🧩 Visual Summary (Mental Model)
Focus        → -p
Decide       → -d
Act next     → -n
Check tasks  → -t
Follow up   → -f
Automate    → -a
Reflect     → -m


This maps nicely to how a CTO’s day flows.

🧱 Implementation Pattern (for workctl)

This is how your shortcuts should resolve internally:

SHORTCUTS = {
    "-p": "pomodoro",
    "-t": "priority",
    "-d": "record-decision",
    "-m": "generate-markdown",
    "-a": "create-tasks",
}


All shortcuts → canonical commands → handlers in COMMAND_ROUTES.

No duplication. No branching logic everywhere.

🚫 Shortcuts to avoid (important)
Shortcut	Why avoid
-c	Ambiguous (create / close / config)
-l	Conflicts with common shell patterns
-x	Too generic
-1, -2	Non-mnemonic
🧠 Why this works long-term

You’ll remember it under pressure

New commands slot in naturally

Other people can learn it in 2 minutes

It mirrors tools like git, kubectl, terraform

This is tool ergonomics, not aesthetics.

🏁 Recommended final set (freeze this)

If you want a minimal but powerful starting set, freeze this:

-p  → pomodoro
-t  → priority
-d  → record-decision
-m  → generate-markdown
-a  → create-tasks


Everything else can come later.

Want me to do the next step?

I can:

implement this shortcut map directly in your workctl

add workctl help grouped by category

add shell autocomplete (zsh/bash)

design a TUI for priorities + pomodoro

Just tell me which one.

give the markdown of this shortcut map to store in repository

Here is a clean, repository-ready Markdown file you can drop directly into your repo (e.g. docs/SHORTCUTS.md or README.md section).

It’s written to be:

concise

scannable

future-proof

understandable by someone new to workctl

workctl Shortcut Map

This document defines the official shortcut map for the workctl command-line tool.

Shortcuts are designed for high-frequency actions, while canonical commands remain the primary interface.

Design Principles

Shortcuts are mnemonic (easy to remember)

Shortcuts are optional — canonical commands always work

One shortcut = one action

No collisions

Flags express actions, commands express nouns

Core Daily Shortcuts

These are intended to become muscle memory.

Shortcut	Canonical Command	Description
-p	pomodoro	Start a 25-minute Pomodoro focus session
-t	priority	Show top priority tasks
-f	follow-ups (planned)	Show pending follow-ups
-n	next (planned)	Show next best action
Thinking & Reflection

Used for deliberate thinking, review, and documentation.

Shortcut	Canonical Command	Description
-d	record-decision	Record a decision
-m	generate-markdown	Generate Markdown report from work logs
Automation & Agents

Used to manually trigger background automation.

Shortcut	Canonical Command	Description
-a	create-tasks	Run email → task creation agent
-r	run-agents (planned)	Run all background agents
System & Meta
Shortcut	Canonical Command	Description
-s	status (planned)	Show system health
-h	help	Show help
-v	version (planned)	Show version information
Canonical Commands (Always Supported)

Shortcuts are aliases only.
The following commands must always work:

workctl pomodoro
workctl priority
workctl create-tasks
workctl record-decision
workctl generate-markdown

Mental Model
-p  Focus (Pomodoro)
-t  Top tasks
-d  Decide
-m  Reflect
-a  Automate

Implementation Notes

Shortcuts are resolved in workctl

Canonical commands are defined in src/cli/commands.py

Business logic must not depend on shortcuts

Extending the Shortcut Map

When adding new shortcuts:

Ensure the action is high-frequency

Choose a mnemonic letter

Avoid collisions

Update this document

Status

This document represents the authoritative shortcut specification for workctl.

If you want, next I can:

auto-generate this into workctl help

enforce shortcut consistency in code

add shell auto-completion using this spec
